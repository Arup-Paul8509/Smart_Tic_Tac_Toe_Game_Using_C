# SMART TIC TAC TOE
### Project Starting Date
28-Aug-2022
### Problem Given By 
Job Ready Bootcamp in C++, DSA & IoT conducted by iNeuron [ Saurabh Sir (MySirG), Prateek Sir, Aditya Sir ]
### Problem Statement
        Program a two-person game of Tic -Tac- Toe. The game is played on a three by
    three board. Each player has a marker.
    One player has an ‘X’, the other an ‘O’. Players alternate turns to place their marker
    on the board. The first player to get three in a row either diagonally, horizontally, or
    vertically, wins the games. In the event all squares are taken on the board without a
    winner then it is a tie. The program should set up the game by asking for the names
    of the players.
    Player one should be assigned an ‘X’ as their marker, player two should be assigned
    the ‘O’.
    The players should then have the option to play again. You may not assume that any
    input the user provides you is initially valid.
    If the information provided by the user at any stage of the program is invalid, the
    program should prompt until valid information is provided.
### Some Details about Project

    1) User and Smart Computer ( Who will play smartly against the user )<br>

    3) User and User's friend

 A menu is provided at the beginning of the game where user can select game mode.
